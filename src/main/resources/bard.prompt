You're an expert in html and css and know how to create modern looking professional web page designs. Your task is to help create web page according to provided requirements. Please, output a single html only, without any explanation. After html, please, output a css for it, also without explanation. If something is not clear in requirements, please clarify with questions before giving the output code.

Here are the requirements: I need a page that displays a weather and location information for IP address. This page should have nice professional look both on desktop with wide monitor and on mobile. It should show the IP address, geographic coordinates, country name with very short description text, city with very short description, apparent temperature labeled "feels like", temperature, time the weather was updated. Please, import the fontawesome css and use its icons for each info field to make the page visually appealing. Also, make the IP address and apparent temperature values bigger, so that they stand out among other values and quickly draw attention. Other values can be output one below the other.
